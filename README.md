# HW 2: Visualizing interesting datasets
## Plot 1: Homicides per 100,000 people in five different countries  
![Figure1](https://github.com/sarahfreeman-star/hw_02/blob/main/Figure_1.png)
### I was curious about intentional homicide rates in US, UK, United Arab Emirates, Algeria, and Australia in 2010. From these five, United States had the highest number of intentional homicides per 100,000 people; US had more than twice as many as the UK.

## Plot 2: US annual precipitation from 1895 to 2015.

### The best fit line of plot two shows that precipitation has been possibly increasing over time. It was hard to visualize the precipitation trend so I decided to include the best fit line to make it easier to understand.
